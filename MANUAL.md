# Hyper Abilities
- Sonic combines his *Hyper Flash* ability from S3&K with his *Drop Dash* maneuver to form the
**Hyper Drop Flash**.  Press jump in mid-air to take off in the direction held, destroying every badnik
on screen while instantly charging up a Drop Dash, you can also do a normal Drop Dash by not holding
any directions while pressing jump in the air.
- Tails reuinites with his **Super Flickies**, still as deadly as ever, rabidly attacking any badnik or boss
Tails could without requiring his attendence.
- Knuckles **Gliding Shock Wave Attack** comes back with with a vengeance!  Now not only retaining
his speed from a jump but increasing it, as well as breaking every badnik AND item box nearby when
colliding with a wall, don't hold forward while gliding to avoid activating.
- Mighty gets the brand-new **Jackhammer Earthquake Attack** which lets him reach never before seen
speeds and altitudes using his *Hammer Drop* ability in conjunction with the environment, cleaning up
badniks in the process.
- Ray's aerobatics are enhanced with his **Jet Glide** which, on pulling up while flying, releases a
super-powered implosion that sucks in rings and blows badniks away while making him as light as
a feather for a small period of time (or until you let go).
