Originally I had this licensed under GPLv2 but considering the fact that the
mod contained large amounts of reverse-engineered code based on software owned
by SEGA either used as a reference (Sonic 3 AIR) or being directly copy-pasted
(Sonic Mania) with minor edits that was probably a very bad idea!

Because I can't rely on legally-binding copyleft agreement all I ask from other
mod makers is to not use this as a compotent of a proprietary, Windows only
project. It would be really disappointing to see something I coded have it's
portability hobbled for some silly anti-competitive reason.
